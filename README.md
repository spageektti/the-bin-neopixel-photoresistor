# Mood Lamp with Adjustable Brightness and Color Patterns

This project is a customizable mood lamp that changes color based on ambient light levels detected by a photoresistor. The brightness and color patterns of the multicolor LED can be adjusted using a slider, allowing you to create a personalized lighting experience.

## Features

- **Light Level Detection**: The photoresistor detects ambient light levels, and the neopixel changes its color accordingly.
- **Adjustable Brightness and Color Patterns**: Use the slider to adjust the brightness of the pixel or change the color patterns, giving you full control over the lampâ€™s ambiance.

## How It Works

1. **Photoresistor**: Measures the ambient light levels.
2. **Multicolor LED (Neopixel)**: Changes color based on the light levels detected by the photoresistor.
3. **Slider**: Allows you to manually adjust the brightness or select different color patterns.
